    "# Code 7.1 â€“ Building a Self-Service Data Visualization Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "This notebook walks through the process of building a simple but powerful \"agent.\"  \n",
    "The goal of this agent is to understand plain-English requests about a dataset, formulate a plan, and use a \"tool chest\" of functions to automatically generate and save data visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise is designed for professionals and demonstrates key concepts in automation and AI, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Tool Use*: Breaking down tasks into modular, reusable functions (tools).\n",
    "- *Planning*: Creating a multi-step sequence of actions to achieve a goal.\n",
    "- *Orchestration*: Executing the plan and passing data between tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Use\n",
    "Simply run each cell in order from top to bottom. The script will create a sample dataset, run several test queries against the agent, and save the resulting charts to a new **OUTPUT** folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Setup and Configuration\n",
    "This first block handles the necessary setup. It imports required libraries, ensures they are installed, and defines several global variables to manage the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Global Variables\n",
    "- **output_dir**: Specifies the folder where all generated charts will be saved.\n",
    "- **figure_counter**: A simple counter to number the output files sequentially.\n",
    "- **generated_files**: A list that will keep track of all successfully created files to provide a summary at the end.\n"

    "## Next Steps and Improvements\n",
    "This notebook provides a solid foundation for a tool-using agent. To improve it further, you could consider the following enhancements:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Add More Tools\n",
    "- Create a `calculate_kpi` tool that computes metrics like Cost-Per-Click (spend / clicks) before plotting.\n",
    "- Implement a `plot_pie_chart` tool for visualizing proportional data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Make the \"Brain\" Smarter\n",
    "- Modify `parse_query` to understand more variations, such as asking for the \"average\" spend (which would use 'mean' in the aggregation step) instead of the \"total\" ('sum').\n",
    "- For a more advanced project, you could replace the keyword-based `parse_query` function with a call to a Large Language Model (LLM) for much more flexible and powerful intent recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expand Data Handling\n",
    "- Modify the `load_csv` tool to be a more generic `load_data` function that can also handle other file types, like Excel (.xlsx) or JSON.\n"
