    "# Code 7.2 - Multi-Agent System for Market Intelligence\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the creation of a sophisticated multi-agent system designed to automate market intelligence gathering. The system features a **Manager Agent** that orchestrates a team of specialist agents to collect, analyze, and synthesize data into a professional intelligence briefing.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab is designed for a professional audience and showcases key principles of modern AI development:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Agent-Based Architecture:** Decomposing a complex task into smaller, manageable responsibilities handled by specialized agents.\n",
    "* **Hybrid Execution:** Managing a mix of parallel and sequential tasks to handle dependencies efficiently.\n",
    "* **AI-Powered Synthesis:** Using an LLM to derive qualitative insights from raw data.\n",
    "* **Robustness:** Incorporating conditional logic to function with or without a live API key and handling potential failures gracefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to Use:** Run each cell sequentially from top to bottom. The notebook will prompt you for an OpenAI API key but is fully functional without one, using mock data as a fallback. The final, enriched report will be displayed and saved to a dynamically named markdown file in the `OUTPUT` directory."
